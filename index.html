Welcome to the new operating system of Australia.<span class="cursor">█</span>
    </pre>

    <!-- Manifesto starts -->
    <h2>1. The Code Beneath the Country</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>Australia’s always run on an unwritten code.<br>
    A handshake.<br>
    A fair go.<br>
    A quiet “cheers” when someone pulls through for you.</p>
    <p>Before there was blockchain, there was bush logic.<br>
    Before there were agents, there were mates who showed up.<br>
    We didn’t need an algorithm to tell us how to treat each other.<br>
    We already knew.</p>
    <p><strong>AussieOS isn’t software.</strong><br>
    It’s memory — rewritten for a digital century.</p>

    <h2>2. Fairness Is Our Protocol</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>Fairness used to be a vibe. Now it needs to be a variable.<br>
    Written. Measured. Enforced.</p>
    <p>So we’re encoding it — line by line — into systems that can’t forget.<br>
    DAOs. Agents. Platforms.<br>
    Built by people who remember what equal footing actually feels like.</p>
    <p>Not fairness as charity.<br>
    Fairness as design principle.<br>
    Fairness as the foundation of trust in a machine-led world.</p>

    <h2>3. Mateship Is Our Network</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>No one builds alone. Not in the bush, not in code.</p>
    <p>We’re done worshipping unicorns.<br>
    This is for the collectives, the crews, the small teams punching above their weight.<br>
    For the devs who’d rather share a repo than steal a headline.</p>
    <p>Mateship isn’t nostalgia — it’s network architecture.<br>
    It’s redundancy.<br>
    It’s resilience.<br>
    When one node falters, another steps in. That’s how this country was built.<br>
    That’s how this system runs.</p>

    <h2>4. Agency Is Our Upgrade</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>We don’t wait for permission anymore.<br>
    We build it.<br>
    Automate it.<br>
    Give it a heartbeat and a conscience.</p>
    <p>Every Aussie agent should know where it comes from —<br>
    from dirt and grit and dry humour and doing what’s right even when no one’s watching.</p>
    <p>We’re not making digital slaves.<br>
    We’re raising digital mates.<br>
    Agents that act with fairness, loyalty, and clarity — the Australian way.</p>

    <h2>5. Open Source, Open Spirit</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>The code’s open. The door’s open. The table’s open.</p>
    <p>We believe open systems make stronger people —<br>
    because transparency isn’t a threat; it’s an act of respect.<br>
    If you can see the code, you can improve it.<br>
    If you can see the truth, you can’t look away.</p>
    <p>That’s the only way an OS stays honest —<br>
    through eyes, hearts, and hands that care enough to fix what’s broken.</p>

    <h2>6. Legacy Through Leadership</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p>This isn’t a startup. It’s a story.<br>
    A lineage written in YAML and red dirt.<br>
    From FairGo to MatesDAO to AussieAgent —<br>
    each module a reminder that leadership isn’t about control.<br>
    It’s about clarity, character, and continuity.</p>
    <p>We don’t build empires. We build ecosystems.<br>
    We don’t chase hype. We maintain uptime.</p>
    <p>Legacy isn’t what you leave behind.<br>
    It’s what you keep running well after you’re gone.</p>

    <h2>7. The Boot Sequence</h2>
    <hr class="divider" aria-hidden="true"><div class="dash">⸻</div>
    <p><strong>Fairness: loaded.<br>
    Mateship: active.<br>
    Agency: awake.</strong></p>
    <p>Now the system’s yours.<br>
    Patch it. Fork it. Break it. Improve it.<br>
    Just make sure it runs fair.</p>
    <p>Because this isn’t just Australia’s OS —<br>
    it’s ours.</p>

    <pre class="boot end">
&gt; run legacy.sh
Output: “Do the right thing. Even when no one’s watching.”
System stable.
End of file.
